# Zwitter
A Twitter Experimental Client developed for making a better User Experience for Twitter Users

One of the main drawbacks of twitter is the limitation of 140 characters.
Most of the people think it is what that makes twitter unique from others.

But still there are people who are not engaging in the twitter because of the linitation.

This app is being developped to give a freedom to the people who are willing to write more than 140 characters.

This app will basically get the count of the characters typed by the user, and try to split it into multipple tweets
with page numbering and tweet them in a loop.

Even though the tweet will be split according to the twitter restriction, the message will be posted in a manner 
where it can be read as one tweet with the help of the page numbering
